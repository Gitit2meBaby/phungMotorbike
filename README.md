# Site makeup
So built with next js, I have tried to keep as much as possible SSR to build SEO.
Though some filtering options could be done client side I have chosen to abstract to different URLS to improve SSO.
- The client 'Mr Phung' has already gained a decent representation with SERP due to the long standing business ettiquette.
- The site is built relying mostly on SSR with abstractions of all click events to Client side.
- A JSON with image links and data has beeen provided for each current motorbike, the main aim is to create dynamically created slugs for any new information provided.
- Overall the basis of this site is on SEO domain authority and although removed from a quicker in app SPA appication, I have tried to create domain authority through providing multiple URL dominance in the Hanoi market.
- Any developer will notice I could have filtered the response from firebase much easier with a simple fetch, but at this point in time with the low MAU i see no reason to constrict well below the current free tier of Firebase and Vercels free tier plan.
- My advice in the future if Mr Phungs website grows beyond the current MAI, push towards creating API's each morning and obstaining from over requestng the Firebase Backend.
